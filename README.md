This is a fun multiple-choice trivia game, which challenges the player to pick out the correct national flag from a group of 4.

Upon hitting the 'Start Game' button, the player is presented with a choice to select either Difficult or Easier mode:
	- Easier mode gives the player 20 seconds for each question
	- Difficult mode gives the player just 10 seconds for each question

The player is then given the option to select the number of questions he/she would like to answer.

Upon selecting the mode, the start buttons and menus are hidden and the game displays a randomly selected question, followed by 4 multiple-choice answers - one is correct, 3 are incorrect.

The player selects his/her choice by clicking on the appropriate flag.

As the question is displayed, a count-down timer is started for each question, allowing the player either 20 or 10 seconds to answer (depending on the mode he/she selected).

If the timer expires, the game treats it as an incorrect answer, and the next question is displayed automatically.

As the player selects his/her answer by clicking a flag, the game displays whether answer is correct or incorrect, and increments the score accordingly.

After a brief pause (1 second), the next question is displayed.

After 10 questions, the total score is displayed.  Other elements are hidden at this time.

A 'Play Again?' button allows the player to start the game again.
